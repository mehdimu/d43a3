.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBALTER GROUP\fR is used to change a user group. The
first two variants add or remove users from a group. Only database
superusers can use this command. Adding a user to a group does not
create the user. Similarly, removing a user from a group does not
drop the user itself.
.PP
The third variant changes the name of the group. Only a database
superuser can rename groups.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fB\fIgroupname\fB\fR
The name of the group to modify.
.TP
\fB\fIusername\fB\fR
Users which are to be added or removed from the group. The users
must exist.
.TP
\fB\fInewname\fB\fR
The new name of the group.

.sp
.nf
ALTER GROUP workers DROP USER beth;
.sp

.SH "COMPATIBILITY"

standard. The concept of roles is similar.
