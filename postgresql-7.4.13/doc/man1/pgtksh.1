.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpgtksh\fR\fR [ \fR\fB\fIfilename\fB \fR [ \fB\fIargument\fB\fR...\fB \fR]\fB \fR\fR]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBpgtksh\fR is a \fBTcl/Tk\fR
shell interface extended with PostgreSQL
database access functions. (Essentially, it is
\fBwish\fR with \fIlibpgtcl\fR loaded.)
Like with \fBwish\fR, the regular
\fBTcl/Tk\fR shell, the first command line
argument is a script file, any remaining arguments are passed to
the script. Special options may be processed by the
\fBX Window System\fR libraries instead.
If no script file is named, the shell is interactive.
.PP
A plain \fBTcl\fR shell with
PostgreSQL functions is available as \fBpgtclsh\fR(1).
