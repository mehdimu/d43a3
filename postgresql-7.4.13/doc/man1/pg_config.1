.SH NAME
pg_config \- retrieve information about the installed version of PostgreSQL

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBpg_config\fR \fR{\fR \fB--bindir\fR\fR | \fR\fB--includedir\fR\fR | \fR\fB--includedir-server\fR\fR | \fR\fB--libdir\fR\fR | \fR\fB--pkglibdir\fR\fR | \fR\fB--configure\fR\fR | \fR\fB--version\fR\fR }\fR\fR...\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBpg_config\fR utility prints configuration parameters
of the currently installed version of PostgreSQL. It is
intended, for example, to be used by software packages that want to interface
to PostgreSQL to facilitate finding the required header files
and libraries.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
To use \fBpg_config\fR, supply one or more of the following options:
.TP
\fB--bindir\fR
Print the location of user executables. Use this, for example, to find
the \fBpsql\fR program. This is normally also the location
where the \fIpg_config\fR program resides. 
.TP
\fB--includedir\fR
Print the location of C header files of the client interfaces.
.TP
\fB--includedir-server\fR
Print the location of C header files for server
programming.
.TP
\fB--libdir\fR
Print the location of object code libraries.
.TP
\fB--pkglibdir\fR
Print the location of dynamically loadable modules, or where
the server would search for them. (Other
architecture-dependent data files may also be installed in this
directory.)
.TP
\fB--configure\fR
Print the options that were given to the \fIconfigure\fR
script when PostgreSQL was configured for building.
This can be used to reproduce the identical configuration, or
to find out with what options a binary package was built. (Note
however that binary packages often contain vendor-specific custom
patches.)
.TP
\fB--version\fR
Print the version of PostgreSQL and exit.
.PP
If more than one option (except for \fB--version\fR) is given, the
information is printed in that order, one item per line.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The option \fB--includedir-server\fR was new in
PostgreSQL 7.2. In prior releases, the server include files were
installed in the same location as the client headers, which could
be queried with the option \fB--includedir\fR. To make your
package handle both cases, try the newer option first and test the
exit status to see whether it succeeded.
.PP
In releases prior to PostgreSQL 7.1, before the
\fBpg_config\fR came to be, a method for finding the
equivalent configuration information did not exist.
.SH "HISTORY"
.PP
The \fBpg_config\fR utility first appeared in
PostgreSQL 7.1.
