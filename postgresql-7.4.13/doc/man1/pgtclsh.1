\fBpgtclsh\fR is a \fBTcl\fR
shell interface extended with
PostgreSQL database access functions.
(Essentially, it is \fBtclsh\fR with
\fIlibpgtcl\fR loaded.) Like with the regular
\fBTcl\fR shell, the first command line
argument is a script file, any remaining arguments are passed to
the script. If no script file is named, the shell is
interactive.

A \fBTcl\fR shell with
\fBTk\fR and
PostgreSQL functions is available as \fBpgtksh\fR(1).
