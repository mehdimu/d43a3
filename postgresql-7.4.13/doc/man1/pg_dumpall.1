.SH NAME
pg_dumpall \- extract a PostgreSQL database cluster into a script file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBpg_dumpall\fR\fR [ \fR\fB\fIoption\fB\fR...\fB \fR\fR]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBpg_dumpall\fR is a utility for writing out
(``dumping'') all PostgreSQL databases
of a cluster into one script file. The script file contains
SQL commands that can be used as input to \fBpsql\fR(1) to restore the databases. It does this by
calling \fBpg_dump\fR(1) for each database in a cluster.
\fBpg_dumpall\fR also dumps global objects
that are common to all databases.
(\fBpg_dump\fR does not save these objects.)
This currently includes information about database users and
groups, and access permissions that apply to databases as a whole.
.PP
Thus, \fBpg_dumpall\fR is an integrated
solution for backing up your databases. But note a limitation:
it cannot dump ``large objects'', since
\fBpg_dump\fR cannot dump such objects into
text files. If you have databases containing large objects,
they should be dumped using one of \fBpg_dump\fR's
non-text output modes.
.PP
Since \fBpg_dumpall\fR reads tables from all
databases you will most likely have to connect as a database
superuser in order to produce a complete dump. Also you will need
superuser privileges to execute the saved script in order to be
allowed to add users and groups, and to create databases.
.PP
The SQL script will be written to the standard output. Shell
operators should be used to redirect it into a file.
.PP
\fBpg_dumpall\fR needs to connect several
times to the PostgreSQL server and might be asking for
a password each time. It is convenient to have a
\fI$HOME/.pgpass\fR file in such cases.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following command-line options are used to control the content and
format of the output.
.TP
\fB-a\fR
.TP
\fB--data-only\fR
Dump only the data, not the schema (data definitions).
.TP
\fB-c\fR
.TP
\fB--clean\fR
Include SQL commands to clean (drop) the databases before
recreating them.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
.TP
\fB--inserts\fR
Dump data as \fBINSERT\fR commands (rather
than \fBCOPY\fR). This will make restoration very
slow, but it makes the output more portable to other SQL database
packages.
.TP
\fB-D\fR
.TP
\fB--column-inserts\fR
.TP
\fB--attribute-inserts\fR
Dump data as \fBINSERT\fR commands with explicit
column names (INSERT INTO
\fItable\fR
(\fIcolumn\fR, ...) VALUES
\&...). This will make restoration very slow,
but it is necessary if you desire to rearrange column ordering.
.TP
\fB-g\fR
.TP
\fB--globals-only\fR
Dump only global objects (users and groups), no databases.
.TP
\fB-i\fR
.TP
\fB--ignore-version\fR
Ignore version mismatch between
\fBpg_dumpall\fR and the database server.

\fBpg_dumpall\fR can handle databases
from previous releases of PostgreSQL, but very
old versions are not supported anymore (currently prior to
7.0). Use this option if you need to override the version
check (and if \fBpg_dumpall\fR then
fails, don't say you weren't warned).
.TP
\fB-o\fR
.TP
\fB--oids\fR
Dump object identifiers (OIDs) for every
table. Use this option if your application references the OID
columns in some way (e.g., in a foreign key constraint).
Otherwise, this option should not be used.
.TP
\fB-s\fR
.TP
\fB--schema-only\fR
Dump only the schema (data definitions), no data.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
.TP
\fB--verbose\fR
Specifies verbose mode. This will cause
\fBpg_dumpall\fR to print progress
messages to standard error.
.TP
\fB-x\fR
.TP
\fB--no-privileges\fR
.TP
\fB--no-acl\fR
Prevent dumping of access privileges (grant/revoke commands).
.PP
.PP
The following command-line options control the database connection parameters.
.TP
\fB-h \fIhost\fB\fR
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the database
server is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is
used as the directory for the Unix domain socket. The default
is taken from the \fBPGHOST\fR environment variable,
if set, else a Unix domain socket connection is attempted.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file
extension on which the server is listening for connections.
Defaults to the \fBPGPORT\fR environment variable, if
set, or a compiled-in default.
.TP
\fB-U \fIusername\fB\fR
Connect as the given user.
.TP
\fB-W\fR
Force a password prompt. This should happen automatically if
the server requires password authentication.
.PP
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
\fBPGHOST\fR
.TP
\fBPGPORT\fR
.TP
\fBPGUSER\fR
Default connection parameters
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Since \fBpg_dumpall\fR calls
\fBpg_dump\fR internally, some diagnostic
messages will refer to \fBpg_dump\fR.
.PP
Once restored, it is wise to run \fBANALYZE\fR on each
database so the optimizer has useful statistics. You
can also run \fBvacuumdb -a -z\fR to analyze all
databases.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To dump all databases:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBpg_dumpall > db.out\fR
.sp
.fi
.PP
To reload this database use, for example:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBpsql -f db.out template1\fR
.sp
.fi
(It is not important to which database you connect here since the
script file created by \fBpg_dumpall\fR will
contain the appropriate commands to create and connect to the saved
databases.)
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBpg_dump\fR(1). Check there for details on possible
error conditions.
