.SH NAME
SET TRANSACTION \- set the characteristics of the current transaction

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
SET TRANSACTION
    [ ISOLATION LEVEL { READ COMMITTED | SERIALIZABLE } ] [ READ WRITE | READ ONLY ]
SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION
    [ ISOLATION LEVEL { READ COMMITTED | SERIALIZABLE } ] [ READ WRITE | READ ONLY ]
.sp
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBSET TRANSACTION\fR command sets the transaction
characteristics of the current transaction. It has no effect on any
subsequent transactions. \fBSET SESSION
CHARACTERISTICS\fR sets the default transaction
characteristics for each transaction of a session. \fBSET
TRANSACTION\fR can override it for an individual
transaction.
.PP
The available transaction characteristics are the transaction
isolation level and the transaction access mode (read/write or
read-only).
.PP
The isolation level of a transaction determines what data the
transaction can see when other transactions are running concurrently.
.TP
\fBREAD COMMITTED\fR
A statement can only see rows committed before it began. This
is the default.
.TP
\fBSERIALIZABLE\fR
The current transaction can only see rows committed before
first query or data-modification statement was executed in this transaction.
.sp
.RS
.B "Tip:"
Intuitively, serializable means that two concurrent
transactions will leave the database in the same state as if
the two has been executed strictly after one another in either
order.
.RE
.sp
.PP
The transaction isolation level cannot be set after the first query
or data-modification statement (\fBSELECT\fR,
\fBINSERT\fR, \fBDELETE\fR,
\fBUPDATE\fR, \fBFETCH\fR,
\fBCOPY\fR) of a transaction has been executed. See
the chapter called ``Concurrency Control'' in the documentation for more information about transaction
isolation and concurrency control.
.PP
The transaction access mode determines whether the transaction is
read/write or read-only. Read/write is the default. When a
transaction is read-only, the following SQL commands are
disallowed: INSERT, UPDATE,
DELETE, and COPY TO if the
table they would write to is not a temporary table; all
CREATE, ALTER, and
DROP commands; COMMENT,
GRANT, REVOKE,
TRUNCATE; and EXPLAIN ANALYZE
and EXECUTE if the command they would execute is
among those listed. This is a high-level notion of read-only that
does not prevent writes to disk.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The session default transaction isolation level can also be set
with the command
.sp
.nf
SET default_transaction_isolation = '\fIvalue\fR'
.sp
.fi
and in the configuration file. Consult the section called ``Run-time Configuration'' in the documentation for more
information.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
Both commands are defined in the SQL standard.
SERIALIZABLE is the default transaction
isolation level in the standard; in PostgreSQL the default is
ordinarily READ COMMITTED, but you can change it as
described above. PostgreSQL does not
provide the isolation levels READ UNCOMMITTED
and REPEATABLE READ. Because of multiversion
concurrency control, the SERIALIZABLE level is
not truly serializable. See the chapter called ``Concurrency Control'' in the documentation for details.
.PP
In the SQL standard, there is one other transaction characteristic
that can be set with these commands: the size of the diagnostics
area. This concept is only for use in embedded SQL.
