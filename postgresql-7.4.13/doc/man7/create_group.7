CREATE GROUP \- define a new user group

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
CREATE GROUP \fIname\fR [ [ WITH ] \fIoption\fR [ ... ] ]

where \fIoption\fR can be:

     SYSID \fIgid\fR
   | USER  \fIusername\fR [, ...]
.sp
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBCREATE GROUP\fR will create a new group in the
database cluster. You must be a database
superuser to use this command.
.PP
Use ALTER GROUP [\fBalter_group\fR(7)]
to change a group's membership, and DROP GROUP [\fBdrop_group\fR(7)] to remove a group.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fB\fIname\fB\fR
The name of the group.
.TP
\fB\fIgid\fB\fR
The SYSID clause can be used to choose
the PostgreSQL group ID of the new
group. It is not necessary to do so, however.

If this is not specified, the highest assigned group ID plus one,
starting at 1, will be used as default.
.TP
\fB\fIusername\fB\fR
A list of users to include in the group. The users must already exist.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Create an empty group:
.sp
.nf
CREATE GROUP staff;
.sp
.fi
.PP
Create a group with members:
.sp
.nf
CREATE GROUP marketing WITH USER jonathan, david;
.sp
.fi
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
There is no \fBCREATE GROUP\fR statement in the SQL
standard. Roles are similar in concept to groups.
