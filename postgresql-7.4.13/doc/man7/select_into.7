.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBSELECT INTO\fR creates a new table and fills it
with data computed by a query. The data is not returned to the
client, as it is with a normal \fBSELECT\fR. The new
table's columns have the names and data types associated with the
output columns of the \fBSELECT\fR.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fBTEMPORARY or TEMP\fR
If specified, the table is created as a temporary table. Refer
to CREATE TABLE [\fBcreate_table\fR(7)] for details.
.TP
\fB\fInew_table\fB\fR
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to be created.
.PP
All other parameters are described in detail under SELECT [\fBselect\fR(7)].

.SH "NOTES"
.PP
CREATE TABLE AS [\fBcreate_table_as\fR(7)]
is functionally equivalent to \fBSELECT INTO\fR.
\fBCREATE TABLE AS\fR is the recommended syntax, since
this form of \fBSELECT INTO\fR is not available in
\fBECPG\fR or
\fBPL/pgSQL\fR, because they interpret the
INTO clause differently.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
The SQL standard uses \fBSELECT ... INTO\fR to
represent selecting values into scalar variables of a host program,
rather than creating a new table. This indeed is the usage found
in \fBECPG\fR and \fBPL/pgSQL\fR.
The PostgreSQL usage of \fBSELECT
INTO\fR to represent table creation is historical. It's
best to use \fBCREATE TABLE AS\fR for this purpose in
new code. (\fBCREATE TABLE AS\fR isn't standard
either, but it's less likely to cause confusion.)
